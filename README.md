## Development

### Getting Started
First, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository, then fire up your command prompt and ...

1. Clone the forked repository
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory: `cd project_name`
3. activate your python virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. `pre-commit install`
5. `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
6. `pre-commit run --all-files`

Now you can start working on the code.

### Tests

Simply run `pytest`. For more detailed output, including test coverage:

```sh
pytest -vv --cov=. --cov-report term-missing
```

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project:

- if you're making code contributions, please try and write some tests to accompany your code, and ensure that the tests pass.
- commit your changes via `cz commit`. Follow the prompts. When you're done, `pre-commit` will be invoked to ensure that your contributions and commits follow defined conventions. See `pre-commit-config.yaml` for more details.
- your commit messages should follow the conventions described [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like `git merge` and `git revert`.
Once you are done, please create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
